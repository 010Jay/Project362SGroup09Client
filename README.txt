Project:
--------
We were asked to assist with the development of an information system for a brand new event planning/catering
company. This company will be organizing events and catering for students at CPUT.
The company needs an information system that will allow them to create events,
allow students to register for that event, and allow students to purchased food and beverages beforehand.
